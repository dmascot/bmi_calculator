/// class BMICalculator
/// this is a singleton class, since we would need one single instance to ensure
///  all properties are being updated and, calculations done are in same instance
///  for expected behavior
///
/// properties:
/// - height: height of the person , this has impact on BMI Calculation
/// - weight: weight of the person, this has impact on BMI Calculation
/// - gender: gender of the person, this does not account for BMI calculation
/// - age: age of the person, this does not account for BMI calculation
/// - bmi: calculated BMI using formula weight(kg)/[height(meter) * height(meter)]
/// - currentBMIStatus: status enum used to display informative text related to
///   BMI result
///
/// Note:
/// all properties are derived from ValueNotifier , which provides much cleaner
/// state management and, as you can see in the __internal() , we have added
/// listener to height and , weight , which triggers BMI calculation.
///
/// cascading effect of this can be noticed in OutputWidget class, which makes
/// use of the ValueListenableBuilder and, triggers widget rebuilt each time
/// bmiValue gets updated
///
///
/// private members:
///  _internal(): to add listener to weight and, height which triggers it to
///  re-calculate BMI
///  _calculateBMI(): function to calculate BMI which updates bmi.value and,
///  triggers rebuild of OutputWidget
